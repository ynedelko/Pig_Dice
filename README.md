Inherited code from: github.com/ahorrocks22

Code edits by Yelena Nedelko and Rachael Berecka

Notes from inherited code authors:
enter 2 player names and hit enter, enter number of dice you want to play with.
hit roll button for respective player, when you want to hold press hold button (might be broken).
Hold is the only way to win game, after you get to minimum points hit hold button (but you know, its broken.)
computer AI construct is made but not working or used at all yet.

good luck.
